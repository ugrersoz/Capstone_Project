INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CYP1A2 GENOTYPES, CAFFEINE METABOLISM AND ENHANCED SPORTS PERFORMANCE:

A GENETIC BASED APPROACH TO OPTIMAL CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION PRACTICES FOR A HEALTHY SPORTS LIFESTYLE IN TURKISH POPULATION



This ‚ÄúCapstone Project‚Äù aims to investigate the relationship between genetics, sports performance and caffeine consumption. With the increasing interest in healthier sports lifestyles, balanced nutrition methods have gained importance. Since different variants of the CYP1A2 gene region responsible for caffeine metabolism can cause individuals to react differently to caffeine, it is crucial to determine the genetic background behind physical parameters. Caffeine is known to enhance sports performance by reducing fatigue, increasing focus and improving endurance. The research will analyze global studies and 1000 Genomes Project genetic data to visualize the relationship between genotypes and caffeine consumption in Turkey with close sample size. In addition, a survey will be conducted to collect current data on genetics, sports and caffeinated food consumption. The aim of the project is to raise awareness about the CYP1A2 gene and caffeine metabolism, the use of caffeine in accordance with the genetic background and genetics-based nutritional practices, starting with caffeine-containing foods to promote a healthy sports lifestyle. It also aims to increase genetic studies for both sedentary and professional individuals in the Turkish population.
